<p class="bodytext"><strong>Transcript:
</strong></p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Ann Forsyth:</strong>&nbsp;Hello.  I'm Ann Forsyth in Britain.  You might not think it, but this semi-derelict house in London's East End.  It's a film studio of sorts.  In fact, strange as it seems, it may possibly be a clue as to why more of British films in 1962 won top awards overseas. <br /><br /> 

But why should a film company throw away the apparent advantages of working in a proper studio, backed up by a big organisation geared to their every need?<br /><br />

Well, that's what I've come here today to find out.<br /><br />

This is the film setting for one of London's big theatrical successes: Harold Pinter's The Caretaker.<br /><br />  

You wouldn't really expect this claustrophobic kitchen sink drama to arouse much enthusiasm in the heart of a film company, but Michael Burkett, the producer, is an enthusiast.  He is one of 6 unpaid partners in the production company.<br /><br />

2 others are Harold Pinter, described as theatre's most original, disturbing and arresting talent, and Clive Donner, the film director.<br /><br />

Having an early-morning breakfast in the not-so-glamorous make-up room, I found the other 3 partners - the only members of an all-male cast: Robert Shaw, Donald Pleasence and Alan Bates.<br /><br />  

Although none of the 6 partners is getting paid for his work on the film and won't until it is released and makes a profit, Jill Carpenter, the make-up artist and the other technicians are paid in the ordinary way.<br /><br />

It takes nearly an hour each morning to transform Donald Pleasence into the scruffy tramp of the play, but the beard is his own.<br /><br />  

Incidentally, this is the third time he has played this role in London's West End, on Broadway and now in the film.<br /><br />

In this tiny attic where the author has set his play, the film is actually being shot.  The enormous limitations of space and lack of technical facilities have forced the film-makers to be inventive and alive.<br />
<br />

Although cheap by present-day standards with a tight 6-week schedule and no colossal studio overheads, the company has had considerable difficulty in raising the money to make the film.<br /><br />  

But with a fanatical belief in their subject, they were able to fire the enthusiasm and get private backing from famous show business personalities: among them Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Peter Sellers and Noel Coward.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Male Voice:</strong>&nbsp;"Come on, boys.  .  79.  Take 2.  Action!"</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Ann Forsyth:</strong>&nbsp;There didn't seem to be much room for me while Donald Pleasence and Robert Shaw were being filmed, but in another attic room, sitting under a bucket, I found Pinter and talked to him.<br />
  <br /> 

Mr Pinter, what I wanted to ask you is what advantages you see in working out of the studio?</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Harold Pinter</strong>:&nbsp;Well, a studio is a studio.  It's large and hygienic.  This is a room.  It smells like a room.  This house smells like a house, and I like the smell.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Ann Forsyth:</strong>&nbsp;Now all of you have made considerable sacrifices to get this film on the floor.  Why?</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Harold Pinter</strong>:&nbsp;We really want to do it very very much and I am very happy that we have been able to do it with the help of a lot of people.  We're doing it on a private subscription kind of thing, which is quite unique in the film-making business.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Ann Forsyth:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you very much, Mr Pinter.<br />
<br />
  The Caretaker's not the only British film to be made this way.  Let's hope it's as great a success as its outstanding forerunners: A <em>Taste of Honey</em> and <em>Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</em>.<br />
<br />
Ann Forsyth, saying goodbye from London.</p>
