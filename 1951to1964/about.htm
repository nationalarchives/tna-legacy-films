              <td align="left">
                <p class="bodytext">From the austerity of the  post-war years, with their lingering shortages, the fifties and early sixties  saw growing affluence. A sense of hope permeated  British society. With this new sense of liberation came a sense of insecurity.  The previous cultural and social status quo began to be questioned. The  suggestion of a more unpredictable, fragmented life loomed. </p>
                <p class="bodytext">With Labour&rsquo;s defeat in the 1951  General Election, the Tory government assumed power. The government was headed  by a 76 year-old Winston Churchill. The Conservatives&rsquo; election  campaign heralded a movement away from Attlee&rsquo;s &lsquo;state control&rsquo; towards greater  individual freedom. Its slogan was &lsquo;Set the People Free&rsquo;. Unemployment remained  low and road haulage and steel production were privatised. The standard of living  rose. </p>
                <p class="bodytext">Three more Conservative prime  ministers followed. Anthony Eden succeeded Churchill. His tenure was  particularly significant on the international stage; the Suez Crisis in 1956  forced Eden&rsquo;s resignation. It also demonstrated that Europe was a diminished  global power in the face of the USA and the Soviet Union. Harold MacMillan,  nicknamed &ldquo;Supermac&rdquo;, replaced Eden and sought to restore a sense of  confidence. </p>
                <p class="bodytext">On the home front there was  restlessness. The country witnessed race riots in 1958. The riots followed the  arrival of newly invited immigrants from the ex-colonies of the West Indies.  The brief succession of Alec Douglas Home in 1963 marked the end of the  Conservatives&rsquo; thirteen-year run in office.</p>
                <p class="bodytext">Socially British life also  underwent significant change. This change was largely brought about by the  birth of mass media. Elizabeth II&rsquo;s coronation in 1953 was a spectacular  affair. Only two million homes had a television but 20 million citizens  watched the coronation. They crammed into families&rsquo;, friends&rsquo; and neighbours&rsquo;  sitting rooms to watch. It was the nation&rsquo;s greatest mass viewing of a  televised event to date.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="bodytext">By the late fifties, the music  and fashion scenes exploded with change. A separate youth culture emerged for  the first time, mirroring what was then happening in America. &ldquo;Mod&rdquo; and  &ldquo;Rocker&rdquo; youth sub-cultures came on the scene. With them came sensationalism,  particularly when the groups clashed violently on a Bank Holiday in 1964. </p>
                <span class="bodytext">By the early sixties a television in every home was becoming the norm.  There was a perceived narrowing in the division between &ldquo;high&rdquo; and &ldquo;mass&rdquo;  culture. This challenged the older belief in a strong class system. For many  this narrowing was becoming a cause of concern. Increased mass access to  education, greater affluence and social mobility blurred previous social  divisions. Women began to see a growing freedom available to them through the  advent of the contraceptive pill. </span>
