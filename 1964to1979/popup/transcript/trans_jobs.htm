<p class="bodytext"><strong>VOICE:</strong>&nbsp;When your daughter goes to work for the first time... </p>
<p class="bodytext">...the excitement she feels, with her own money to spend... </p>
<p class="bodytext">...and crowds of new friends... </p>
<p class="bodytext">...maybe she won&rsquo;t care what job she does - before the gloss wears off...</p>
<p class="bodytext">...she may get married and have a family...</p> 
<p class="bodytext">...and it&rsquo;s only when she thinks about working again that she&rsquo;ll feel let down... </p>
<p class="bodytext">...going back to unskilled work... But if she gets help to prepare for a satisfying job now, then later on, she&rsquo;ll have a career to go on with. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Make sure your daughter sees her career teacher at school, and the local careers officer. </p>
