</strong></p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>PETUNIA:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, Joe!  I have enjoyed our country walk. </p> 

<p class="bodytext"><strong>JOE:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, we've come a long way, Petunia.  Look!  You can see our tracks right across that yellow cornfield.</p>

<p class="bodytext"><strong>PETUNIA:</strong>&nbsp;Oh yes!  It's ever so nice in this field.  I'm glad those cows have gone.</p>

<p class="bodytext"><strong>JOE:</strong>&nbsp;Aye!  They've taken themselves off for a walk down that road &ndash; look - through that gate I opened &ndash; the one marked "Private". </p> 

<p class="bodytext"><strong>PETUNIA:</strong>&nbsp;Our little Bingo is having a lovely time playing with those sheep.  The exercise will do him good. </p> 

<p class="bodytext">[sound of enthusiastic barking and baa-ing of terrified sheep]</p>

<p class="bodytext">[Joe throws a stone.  A bottle smashes.]</p>

<p class="bodytext"><strong>JOE:</strong>&nbsp;Hey, hey!  I've hit that bottle, Petunia!  It smashed up a treat.</p>  

<p class="bodytext"><strong>PETUNIA:</strong>&nbsp;Very clever.</p>  

<p class="bodytext"><strong>JOE:</strong>&nbsp;You know, there's a farmer there with a purple face. </p> 

<p class="bodytext"><strong>PETUNIA:</strong>&nbsp;I expect it's all that sun and the open-air life, Joe.</p>

<p class="bodytext"><strong>JOE:</strong>&nbsp;Now he's doing one of those country dances.</p>

<p class="bodytext"><strong>PETUNIA:</strong>&nbsp;I don't think he looks very friendly. </p> 

<p class="bodytext"><strong>JOE:</strong>&nbsp;Maybe you're right.  It can't be anything we've done.</p>

<p class="bodytext"><strong>PETUNIA:</strong>&nbsp;No!  But I won't stay where I'm not wanted.  Come on, Joe!</p>

<p class="bodytext"><strong>FARMER:</strong>&nbsp;When folk come out to the country, why oh why won't they follow the Country Code?</p>
