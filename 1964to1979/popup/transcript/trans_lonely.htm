<p class="bodytext"><strong>Transcript:
</strong></p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>VOICE:</strong>&nbsp;I am the Spirit of Dark and Lonely Water, ready to trap the unwary, the show-off, the fool, and this is the kind of place you&rsquo;d expect to find me. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>VOICE:</strong>&nbsp;But no-one expects to find me here... it seems too ordinary. But that pool is deep. The boy is showing off. The bank is slippery. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>VOICE:</strong>&nbsp; The show-offs are easy. But the unwary ones are easier still. This branch is weak, rotten, it&rsquo;ll never take his weight. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>VOICE:</strong>&nbsp; Only a fool would ignore this. But there's one born every minute. Under the water there are traps. Old cars, bedsteads, weeds, hidden depths. It's the perfect place for an accident.</p>  
<p class="bodytext"><strong>BOY:</strong>&nbsp; Oi look there&rsquo;s someone in the water. Get us that big stick to get him out.</p>  
<p class="bodytext"><strong>VOICE:</strong>&nbsp;Sensible children! I have no power over them! </p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>BOY:</strong>&nbsp; Oi mate that's a stupid place to swim. Hey go over there and get that thing to wrap him in. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>BOY:</strong>&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t half feel cold mate. How long was you in there? </p> 
<p class="bodytext"><strong>VOICE:</strong>&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be back (heavy echo repeats)</p>
