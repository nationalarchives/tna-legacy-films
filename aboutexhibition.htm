                <h2>The Central Office of Information (COI) </h2>
                <p class="bodytext"> COI is the centre of marketing&nbsp;excellence for government. It was established in 1946&nbsp;to replace the wartime Ministry of Information and provide communication services to government departments.  Over COI's 60 years, it has worked on thousands of groundbreaking projects that have helped to shape attitudes and change public behaviour as well as providing citizens with important information.  COI's vast archive of work provides unique historical insight into culture and innovation, from dealing with the issues of post-war Britain right up to the innovative campaigns of today. </p>

Film Images (London) was established in 1989 as a comprehensive film and video resource for organisations requiring clips and stock shots for all kinds of productions. They manage collections from a wide variety of sources worldwide, from government organisations, small collectors and individual cinematographers through to commercial film libraries. All their material is available on VHS viewing tapes and is fully searchable on an on-line database.</p>

Its online resources include the Television and Radio  Index for Learning and Teaching, the Moving Image Gateway and the British  Universities Newsreel Database. Through its research activities it has created  substantial resources for the study of history through film, mostly recently by  its Arts and Humanities Research Council-funded project, &lsquo;Cinemagazines and the  Projection of Britain&rsquo;, which is investigating how the cinemagazine format was  used by the COI, and other organisations, to influence and inform international  opinion on Britain&rsquo;s position in a post-war world.</p>
