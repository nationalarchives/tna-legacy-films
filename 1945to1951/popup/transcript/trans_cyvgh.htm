		<td><h2>Your Very Good Health</h2><br />
<p class="bodytext">Taken from the production file (Catalogue reference: INF 6/1969)</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Commentator:</strong>  In the past we've had all sorts of Public Health Services such as main drainage and water supply.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Everyone makes use of these services and everyone pays for them!
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Refuse disposal is another of these services and so is street
    cleaning.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">These are all Public Health Services, but the new Health Act
      proposes to organise &rsquo;PERSONAL&rsquo; health services in the same way.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">There have been many personal health services, but different
        kinds of financial arrangements.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Charley:</strong>  Morning George.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>George:</strong>  Morning Charles,
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Commentator:</strong>  Morning,  Some people could afford them, others could not.  Some places were well off for hospitals others were unlucky.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">This new health service will be organised on a national scale as a
              public responsibility.  The cost of the service will be met from
              rates, taxes and National Insurance - and so everyone will pay for it.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Charley:</strong>  Huh!  Thought there was a catch in it.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Commentator:</strong>  And everyone will benefit from it. When you're ill you won&rsquo;t have to pay for treatment.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Charley:</strong>  I don't have to pay the doctor now!  I&rsquo;m on the panel.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Commentator:</strong>  Yes, that's true.  But your wife and children aren't.  The panel system covers only half the population.  And it doesn't  cover
                    hospital treatment  or a  lot  of other things, does it?
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now suppose - just suppose you fall off your bike. Suppose your brakes give out.
                      
You might have concussion as well.
                      You&rsquo;d be carted off in an ambulance, which might 
                      cost a couple of quid, and then you&rsquo;d have to pay the hospital too.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">All right! (Whistle)
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Charley:</strong>  Whew! Glad that&rsquo;s over.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Commentator:</strong>  The new health service would cover all this.    
                        Now let's consider it from the family viewpoint.
                        Suppose your wife falls ill suddenly.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Charley:</strong>  But my old woman never is ill - strong as a blooming horse she is!
</p>
<p class="bodytext"> <strong>Mrs. Charley:</strong>  We mothers can't afford to be ill - I am not  insured.    
                          Just a minute, ducks.    
                          And besides I can't take time off from my job!
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Commentator:</strong>  Well that's  just  it. Now let's see how the New Health Act will actually help you.  The local council will have a new duty to
                          provide home nursing, health visiting, and home help services.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">And you&rsquo;ll be able to call on them.  Maternity and child welfare
                          services will be improved.  And finally, to prevent  illness,
                          you'll have  the advice  of your own doctor.  If you are ill, you'll
                          have  specialist  services  if you need them - without worrying about
                          the  cost.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Mrs. Charley:</strong> That's more like it.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Charley:</strong>  How does the whole  scheme work?
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Commentator:</strong>  Well, suppose we see how it is at present.  Hospitals were built haphazard according to the varying foresight and resources of many different authorities, with extremely patchy results.  
                              Re-organising will take time, but at the end of it  the country will
                              have  the sort of hospitals and other services it needs where they
                              are needed.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">The  family doctor will usually work in his own surgery as he does
                              now, but  special Health Centres will gradually be established as
                              building allows.  He will be backed up,  your doctor I mean, by
                              organised hospitals and  specialist  services for the really difficult
                              cases, a  lesson we  learned during the war.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Charley:</strong>  Sounds a bit of all right to me.  But  -  just a minute.  Where do I come in?
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Commentator:</strong>  Right here!  Let's have a  practical demonstration.  Off you go to the doctor.  You have some unusual illness which can't be diagnosed. 
          </p>
<p class="bodytext">He'll no doubt wish you to see a specialist.  In hospital you'll
                                be under observation.  This will include X-ray if it's found necessary.
                                They may decide you need special drugs.  Or blood transfusion.  And
                                they'll be able to make use of the path lab,  to find out what's
                                wrong, and how best to make you well.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Charley:</strong>  Whew,  glad that's over!
                                  
But look here.  How about the people who don't want to use this
                                  service.  Take OLD GEORGE up the road for instance.  Bet you a
                                  pound to a penny HE won't want to have anything to do with it.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Commentator:</strong>  Well, let's find out.
          </p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Charley:</strong>  Morning George.  Busy?
                                  Here, what's your opinion  of this new Health Act?
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>George:</strong>  No use to me,  old man.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Charley:</strong> Now wait a minute.  Just suppose, only suppose mind you, you
                                      fell off that  ladder?  What would happen? </p><p class="bodytext"><strong>George:</strong>  I should call my doctor and have a private ward at the local
                                    hospital.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Charley:</strong>  All right, George,  if you want to pay private fees that's your
                                    look out.  No one's FORCING you to use  this service.
                                    
But  suppose instead of a simple broken  leg you have a complicated
                                    break.  And suppose you have to spend months off sick.  And suppose
                                    you don't need just one doctor but  another expert's opinion.
                                    What&rsquo;s the answer to THAT? 
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>George:</strong>  Ruin.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Charley:</strong> With this new Act you&rsquo;re covered against things like that.
</p><p class="bodytext"><strong>George:</strong>  I  say,  thanks a lot  old man.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Commentator:</strong>  It's all yours whenever you want it with your own choice of doctor.  And that goes  for the whole family.  
                                          The scheme is comprehensive.   It's not  only to help you when you are ill but to help to keep you well.  And of course the younger generation
                                          will stand to  gain  the biggest benefits of all. </p></td>
