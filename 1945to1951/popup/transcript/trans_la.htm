		<td><h2>London Airport</h2><br />
<p class="bodytext">Taken from the production file (catalogue reference: INF 6/992)</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Pilot:</strong> Hullo,  London Tower,   this is Trans-Canada Charlie-Fox-Peter-
Baker-Dog.    Approaching, your field at five thousand feet.
Request  landing instructions.     Over.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Controller:</strong>  Charlie-Baker-Dog.   This is London Tower.  Runway number
  one-zero.  Call me &quot;when on final.  Over.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Pilot:</strong>    This is, Charlie-Baker-Dog.  Roger.  Out.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Commentator:</strong>      Aircraft  coming in from all quarters of the sky,   sometimes
      one every two minutes laden with men and cargoes of all nations
      make this new port of London one of the new  junctions of the
      world.  They call it Heathrow locally.
      </p>
<p class="bodytext">A few years back it was  seven square miles of quiet Middlesex countryside.       
        </p>
<p class="bodytext">It was in April 1944 that history came to these country fields.  An
        airport was  required to help finish off the Japanese,   an airport
        for our heavy far-flying aircraft  - an immediate need with an
        eye to the peaceful future.  That was  the beginning,   and the
        landscape was changed and the past obliterated.  Then from the
        huge cement-mills oceans of concrete like heavy lather poured    
        forth to form the solid runways.  Specimens of the concrete
        ax'e tested to destruction-point in machines which develop a
        pressure of over fifty tons to the square inch.      
        Now,   as the runways stretch forth under the hands of the concreting gangs,
        the bulldozers, scrapers and grabs run out before them,
        preparing more ground and digging trenches for the complicated
        system of drains and cables that  lies below the concrete.
        At the end of 1945, No. 1 runway was complete.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Lord Winster:</strong>        On this first day of the New Year this proving flight
        starts off over Heathrow which will be the future civil
        airport of London and it takes off from the finest runway in
        the world.  
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Commentator:</strong>        On January 1st 1946 with one runway in service and two others
        near completion,  Heathrow officially became London Airport.
        Thus  in under two years British engineers had built and were
        operating one of the largest civil aerodromes in the world.
        But those were still pioneer days, and it was time of flux and
        improvisation.  Marquees, caravans and R.A.F.  huts were the
        airline offices, custom sheds and passenger lounges of these
        days.  It was  like a circus,  but it was also history in the
        making.  The local inhabitants,  however,  see things from a
        different angle.  To the older ones it must have been strange
        indeed to see giant aircraft roaring down paths that once they
        knew as pleasant  loitering lanes.  Stranger still to see the
        streams that they had known since childhood turned aside from
        their old winding courses to the new straight concrete beds,
        and strange to see the familiar farms swept from the earth as
        though by a whirlwind. And (surely the unkindest cut of all)
        few of their pubs may have to go.  But  for many it has meant
        changes of a different  kind, and a lot  have found work on the
        site, where they will remain until the airfield is finished, for
        the port is still building.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Each time a pilot  comes in from the other side of the world,
        he sees new changes.  From this busy vantage  of control towers,
        offices and hangars, are drawn all the  skeins of the web of the
        world's  airways.  This port has been found.  It has come to stay.
        Already it provides every scientific facility and every type of
        information necessary for the safe navigation of  the air.  But
        fog and mist,  wind and rain - these are the chief hazards of the
        air.  The Met. Office is in touch with weather stations all
        over the world,  but no matter how evil the weather, how thick the
        sky with fog or cloud or rain, there is still the airport's
        magic eye which sees the pilot safely to land.  Black and blind
        as it may be up above, safely, surely, they lead him down to the
        runway. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">This now is London's Airport.  Out of the sky and into
        the sky, day and night the travellers come and go.  Last
        year it was four hundred thousand - next year it will be many
        more.  All this requires careful, intricate and precise
        organisation.  Difficult enough under the best conditions -
        yet here a major air junction is being operated while its
        buildings and runways are still growing up around it.  This
        building will &quot;continue for perhaps six years yet, for its
        plans are vast.  But in the end, no natter what the future
        of aircraft may be - Stratocruiser,  Brabazon or flying-wing -
        here will be an airfield second to none,   for London Airport
        is on the map.
