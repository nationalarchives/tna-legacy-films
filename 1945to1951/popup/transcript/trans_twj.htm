		<td><h2>The Wonder Jet</h2><br />
<p class="bodytext">Taken from the production file (Catalogue reference: INF 6/408)</p>
<p class="bodytext">Here it is.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the precise language of the
  engineer, it&rsquo;s called the jet
  propulsion gas turbine.  To you
  and me, it&rsquo;s the jet engine - one
  of  the marvels of this century of
  marvels.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">When they start it up - stand
    back!  Its deep-throated voice
    will  climb to  the  shrieking of a
    thousand fiends.
    </p>
<p class="bodytext">Its flaming breath is white-hot
      gas,  fed by draughts  of liquid
      fuel.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Watch that gallon go!
        </p>
<p class="bodytext">And all around, the straining
        fury of its power sets the very
        air a-shudder.
        </p>
<p class="bodytext">Here is the inside story:
          
  <br />
  air and fuel ignited in combustion chambers  
        and the resulting
        gas ejected through a jet-pipe at
        the rear.
        Now, in the path of the rushing
        gas, insert a bladed wheel:  a
        turbine.  Link the turbine to a
        powerful fan - so placed as to
        ram the air into the combustion
        chambers under pressure.
        Let the gas drive the turbine and
        the fan.  Under fierce compression the temperature rises - and
        the expanding gas roars from the
        jet-pipe with tremendous force.
          

          

        This is the turbine jet - the
        power that is driving the fighters
        of today through the sonic
        barrier.
        </p>
<p class="bodytext">Now, on the forward end of the
        shafting system, mount an air-
        screw.   Here is another new
        means of propulsion:  the turbine
        propellor</p>
<p class="bodytext">The engine that is opening
          fresh vistas of simplicity,
          efficiency, speed.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">To the British aircraft-industry,
          the turbine jet and turbine
          propellor engines have brought a
          golden opportunity.   Says the
          dean of British air designers,
          Charles Clement Walker: </p>
<p class="bodytext">&quot;In this new form of air travel,
          Britain has a chance to make up
          the leeway lost in the war when
          we were developing combat air-craft to the exclusion of all
          else&quot;
</p>
<p class="bodytext">In many a research centre, they
          are grappling with the special
          problems posed by the enormous
          power of the jet.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">And as Britains&rsquo;s new prototypes 
          take  shape - planes which many
          believe will give her a leading
          edge  in the competition of the
          sky - a glimpse of the future
          they are heralding is given by
          the well-known air-line
          executive, Peter Masefield:
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&quot;At a speed of two thousand miles
          an hour, which is at least in
          sight,  the journey from London
          to New York could be completed
          non-stop in about  two hours,
          and because New York time is
          five hours back on London's time,
          passengers could leave London
          after lunch - say at  two o'clock
          in the afternoon and arrive in
          New York for eleven o'clock Coke
          the same morning. &quot; </p>
<p class="bodytext">&quot;So as far as the clock goes,
          they have  arrived three hours
          before  they have  started. &quot;
          
No wonder that amid such promise
          of adventure,  the rising genera-
          tion should desert old loyalties
          to the footplate and the fire
          brigade:  should crane its neck
          skyward to the streaking silver
          that bespeaks tomorrow.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&quot;It's  a Meteor&quot;.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&quot;Look an AW 52&quot;.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&quot;SR.A1 fighting flying
              boat.  Gosh,  look it's
              upside down!&quot; &quot;Hawker N7/46.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&quot;That's  a Vampire&quot;.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">No wonder,  too, that the eerie
                whistle of the jet should have
                brought a mysterious jargon all
                its own to the language of the
                engineer.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>1st Man:</strong> &quot;Well, with the
                tubular type heat exchanger,
                to get the area, you want a
                lot of tubes and consequently
                the inside diameters of the
                tubes are very small.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Consequently the power output
                of the engine goes down just
                like this.&quot;
        </p>
<p class="bodytext">It began in the year 1926.
          Remember?  1926,	when the symbol of Great
                  Britain was a famous bowler
                  hat, when America stood silent  at
          Valentino's grave, when Suzanne Lenglen was queen
          of the centre court at Wimbledon, when Donaghue was booting home
          the winners. </p>
<p class="bodytext">In that year,  at the Royal Air
        Force College at Cranwell, there was a young cadet who had
        been interested in aircraft since
        .the tender age of three.  His
        name:  Frank whittle.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now -  in his nineteenth year  -
        Cadet Whittle wrote a thesis.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">His  idea was not new.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Two thousand years ago,  Hero of
          Alexandria had thought of it.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Later in the pages of history,
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Newton had given it his passing
            attention.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">But  whittle  believed  that  this
            Idea could - fly
</p>
<p class="bodytext">It was fortunate indeed that
            Whittle&rsquo;s notions should gain
                    the sympathetic ear of his
                    instructor, Flight Lieutenant
                    Patrick Johnson:  doubly
                    fortunate that Johnson happened
                    to be well acquainted with the
                    world of patents.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Johnson:</strong> &quot;Well, come and tell
                    me about it.&quot;
        </p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Whittle: </strong>&quot;Have you got time
                    now?&quot;
        </p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Johnson:</strong> &quot;Yes,  rather&quot;.
          </p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Whittle:</strong> &quot;Well,  look ..&quot;
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Whittle: </strong>&quot;This represents a
                      centrifugal type of compressor,
                      like an enlarged supercharger.
                      I use this to pull in air at
                      the front and to compress it
                      into the combustion chambers
                      like this, where the injection
                      and burning of fuel heats and
                      expands the air and. gives it
                      enough energy to drive a
                      turbine which drives the
                      compressor after which the air
                      still has enough energy to give
                      a high velocity propelling jet.&quot;
        </p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Johnson: </strong>&quot;Have  you ever
                      patented anything?&quot;
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Whittle: </strong>&quot;No, I don't know a
                      thing about it,  Does a
                      patent both publish and
                      protect?&quot;
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Johnson:</strong> &quot;That's the whole
                      point of patents. But one
                      thing's essential,  to file the
                      patent application before
                      touting round.  Otherwise you
                      haven't a hope.&quot;
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Johnson:</strong> &quot;Tell you what, let's
                      rough out a specification now.&quot;
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Whittle: </strong>&quot;Fine, what do we do?&quot;
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Johnson:</strong> &quot;well, you make rather
                        A clearer sketch and I'll get
                        on with the clever bit,  the
                        writing.&quot;
                        
And so with the specifications
                        of an idea tucked under  his arm,
                        
Johnson walked, through London's
                        statelv Inns of Court.
                        
On his way, he glanced into  the
                        Library:
                        
that famous Library where the
                        walls are lined with dreams 
                        
illustrious, unknown, crazy.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Would this dream fade forgotten
                        too?  Or might it usher in a
                        revolution in technology?
                        
In the county of Leicestershire
                        stands the town of Lutterworth.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Here, John Wycliffe was born.
                        From here, Thomas Cook organised
                        his first tour.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">And here, too, in a disused
                        foundry, a little company set
                        out to bring the idea of the jet
                        to roaring life.
          </p>
<p class="bodytext">Here, whittle and his associates
                        started up the age of the gas
                        turbine - and in so doing,
                        embarked on the inventor's long
                        road of discouragement and
                        danger.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Man:</strong> &quot;Come back&quot;.
          </p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Man:</strong> &quot;Come back&quot;.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">England heard little  of all  this.
                          but what it heard convinced it
                          that this idea could only fly in
                          the face of all experience.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>1st Golfer:</strong> &quot;Have you heard the
                          latest crazy idea about aero
                          engines?  Some Air Force
                          chap - Whittle I think his
                          name is - or  something like
                          that.&quot;
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>2nd Golfer:</strong> &quot;Yes,  something
                          about gas at five hundred or
                          six hundred degrees tempera-
                          ture.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>1st Golfer:</strong> &quot;Nothing can take a
                          temperature like that - why,
                          the whole thing would explode in his face.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">But across the fields of
                          Leicestershire, across the hunting shires
                          where  Squire Obaldeston ran his
                          thirty miles a day,  and Nimrod
                          talked horses all night while
                          the  port went round,
                          
a new music began to mingle with
                          the sound of hoof and horn:  the
                          whining cry of a gas turbine,
                          running sweet and true.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">But, as yet, only for a moment.
                          Time and time again they saw the
                          instant of success dissolve once
                          more into weary hours of failure.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Whittle:</strong> &quot;I'm sorry to say
                          we&rsquo;ye just had another blade
                          failure.  We were running at
                          practically full speed when
                          one of the blades came off.&quot;
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Whittle: </strong>&quot;If we can only get
                          another fifty degrees Centi-
                          grade,  it'll do the trick.&quot;
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Whittle:</strong> &quot;Yes,  please do.  I&rsquo;m
                          sure we&rsquo;re almost there.&quot;
</p>
<p class="bodytext">They were - almost there. For
                          in the final months of World War 2 
                          the idea was not only aloft,
                          but on active service. And as
                          the  British Meteors tore into
                          the flying bombs,   jet met jet in
                          combat.
          </p>
<p class="bodytext">In a few short years the gas
                          turbine has burnt its fiery mark
                          into the calculations of
                          engineers and economists alike.
          </p>
<p class="bodytext">Yesterday a hope in the minds of
                          a dogged few,
                          today manpower and money on a
                          national scale are flowing into
                          its development.  For in this
                          latest wonder of applied science,
                          Britain sees a source of her
                          future wealth and welfare.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">To the birthplace of the jet are
                          coming students  from all the
                          world,  to take their first peep
                          at this child, of Britain&rsquo;s
                          brains.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">But most vital to a people whose
                          memorials of the poignant past
                          daily remind them of the stark
                          needs of the present,  is  the
                          fact that this invention places
                          in their hands  an export
                          attractive to nearly every
                          progressive country overseas.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the factories whose devoted
                          labour sustained the fighter
                          pilots through the days of peril,
                          
skills famous the world over are
                          now working to capacity on
                          foreign orders for a new prime
                          mover at once cheap,  efficient,
                          simple.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">And in the heart of London,  the
                          company which pioneered the jet
                          now adds to Britain's earnings
                          of foreign currency by the sale
                          of licenses abroad.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Johnson:</strong> &quot;We&rsquo;re prepared to
                          grant your company a license
                          under these patents and an
                          option under the ether three
                          hundred or so which applies to
                          gas turbines in general on the
                          terms I gave you yesterday.&quot;
        </p>
<p class="bodytext">Meanwhile - screaming from the
        rooftops  to the stratosphere -
        the jet is opening realms of
        height and speed hitherto unknown
        to
                          
British test pilots like John
        Cunningham and John Derry.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Cunningham: </strong>&quot;The greatest height
                          we've been to so far is 59,446
                          feet which is nearly twelve
                          miles high and about double the
                          height of Everest.&quot;
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Derry:</strong> &quot;We have exceeded the
                          speed of sound in the D.H. 108
                          which has done most of the work
                          and,  contrary to opinion,  this
                          has no physical effect on the
                          human body.&quot;
                          
History,  they say is but a
                          series of exploded ideas.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Each day,  each hour,  the jet
                          propulsion gas turbine is making
                          history before our eyes - piling
                          record  upon record-breaking
                          record  -  shattering the  accepted
                          ideas  and  limits  of the piston-
                          engine age.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">But  today,  British engineers  are
                          fore telling as great a future for
                          this marvel on the groud as in
                          the air.
                          In workshops which were know to
                          Watt and Stephenson,  they are now
                          forging a second industrial
                          revolution - based on the gas
                          turbine.
                          Soon,  a crack British Railways
                          express will be gas-turbine
                          hauled.  Says Chief Engineer
                          Hawksworth of the Western Region:
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Hawksworth: </strong>&quot;Two locomotives
                          powered  by gas turbines are at
                          present under construction for
                          the Western Region of the
                          British Railways.&quot;
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Hawksworth: </strong>&quot;We hope to use
                          them to pull the famous Corn-
                          ish Riviera Express and we
                          believe they will be capable
                          of very high average speeds.&quot;
                          
From other furnaces are coming
                          the  special secret-formula
                          metals to start the new power
                          source on its career at sea.
          </p>
<p class="bodytext">Soon,  one of Britain's largest
                          tankers will be equipped, with a
                          marine gas turbine engine,
                          designed to give maximum
                          performance on the cheapest of
                          fuels.
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Captain:</strong> &quot;I've just had a
                          commnunication from the Company
                          in which, they say that our gas
                          turbine is nearly ready.&quot;
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Chief. Engineer:</strong> &quot;We are all
                          ready to accommodate it and
                          test it out in sea-going
                          conditions.&quot;
                          
But Captain MacDougall will not
                          be the first skipper to sail
                          under gas.  For already under
                          trial is the first gas turbine
                          warship - His Majesty1s

<p class="bodytext">By land, and sea and air the story
                            is the same.  From Britain's
                            laboratories and factories and
                            airfields the whistle of the jet
                            is spreading all around the globe -
                            a contribution of dimensions yet
                            unfathomed to mankind's mastery
                            of space and speed and power.</p>
